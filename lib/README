libdec.a is needed for compilation of nix_arep, nix_meta, nix_pilo and
nix_temp (see arep.make, meta.make, pilo.make and temp.make in ../binsrc)

libdecx.a is needed for compilation of drau2bufr and syno2bufr (see
Makefile in ../binsrc/obs2bufr).

Source code for libdec.a in ../libsrc1 and ../include1.
Source code for libdecx.a in ../libsrc2 and ../include2.

libdecx.a differs from libdec.a in that routines not needed in
<obstype>2bufr have been stripped off (most notably BUFR handling
routines which have replacements in libbufr), and subroutines used in
more than one <obstype>2bufr have been added (and datum.f has been
completely rewritten).

Originally, all nix_<obstype>.F were planned to be replaced by
<obstype>2bufr.F and then libdec.a would no longer needed.
